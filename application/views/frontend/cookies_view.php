  <h4 class="margin-top-25">  When you use a location-enabled FUNCANO Service, such as our mobile applications, we will request your permission to collect and process information about your actual location, like latitude and longitude provided by the location services of your mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as using your IP address to look up geographic information. We collect this and other information using the following technologies:	</h4>

    <h4> Local storage / Flash.</h4>	

    We may use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your Site preferences, to personalize your visit, or to display content based upon what you view on our Site. Third Parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, may use Flash cookies to collect and store information. We do not have access to or control over these third party cookies nor does this Privacy Policy cover such third parties' use of data. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot typically control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash cookies through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose Global Storage Settings Panel. We may collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.	

   <h4> Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs).	</h4>

    We or the third parties we engage to track and analyze Site Data may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) to help us better manage content on the Site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. In addition, emails we send may contain a web beacon which allows us to understand the time and date of when you open an email and when you utilized a link within the email. Our web beacons do not collect Personally Identifiable Information. Users wishing to disable our web beacons should do so by turning images off in their email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see your email provider for more information.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Users of our Service who disable cookies will be able to use certain features of the Service, but some features may not function including personalization and content recommendations.	

    We, or a data provider we have engaged, may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads, content or services.
